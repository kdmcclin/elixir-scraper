# Scraper

This is a basic web scraper that pulls the title of the Packt Publishing [free book of the day](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) so I know if I might want to check the website and get it.

##Future Steps
*  Pull more than the title (add the description) so that I know more about the book
	*  especially for books that don't clearly indicate what technology or topic they're about
*  Add functionality to text, email, or otherwise alert me so I don't have to run it myself
  *  or add as a Slack bot for one of my Slack groups
